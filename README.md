# 🎨 UI Elements Lab

**UI Elements Lab** is a personal collection of creative UI components built using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  
I created this repository as a dedicated space to practice designing and developing small UI elements that help me improve my frontend and design skills.

## 🌟 Why This Repo Exists

- To practice building clean, modern UI components  
- To experiment with animations, micro-interactions, and visual effects  
- To deepen my understanding of CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript behaviour  
- To strengthen my design sense through daily UI creation  
- To build a reusable collection of UI ideas and patterns  

This repo is simply my creative playground to learn, experiment, and grow as a frontend developer.
